# Pokédex

Hello there! Welcome to the world of Pokémon!

My name is Oak! People call me the Pokémon Prof!  
This world is inhabited by creatures called Pokémon!  
**All `Pokémon` have a `name`, `type` and `weight`**

How would you like to help me out? I am currently working on the latest version of the Pokédex. It lets us catalogue any Pokémon you've seen or caught.

With this Pokédex, I want to be able to:

* See all the Pokémons recorded

* Be able to log any new Pokémon

* Be able to edit a Pokémon's name, type and weight

Be sure to follow RESTful routing when building this Pokédex! You'll need to create your own migrations, model and database, so you've your work cut out for you!

If you are done, perhaps you can figure out a way to incorporate images into the Pokédex, using external URL's!
